# Valorant Points Manager (VPM)
The **Valorant Points Manager** is a Solidity-based smart contract that manages a playerâ€™s point system for a reward-based application. This contract allows users to earn points, redeem rewards, and ensures administrative controls for managing point-related configurations.

---

## Requirements
This project meets the following requirements:
1. Players can **earn points** through the `earnPoints` function.
2. Players can **redeem rewards** by spending points using the `redeemReward` function.
3. Players can **purchase skins** by spending points using the `purchaseSkin` function
4. The contract owner has the ability to:
   - Set the cost of redeeming rewards.
   - Define the maximum allowable points.
   - Update system configurations like reward cost.

All requirements have been implemented and tested in the contract.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this code, utilize Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Begin by visiting the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org.

Upon accessing the Remix platform, click the "+" icon in the left sidebar to create a new file. You may name the file as you prefer, provided it retains the .sol extension. Once the file is created, copy and paste the code provided below into your newly created file.

To compile the Solidity code, first navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab located on the left sidebar. Before proceeding, ensure the Compiler version is set to 0.8.18 or another compatible version that suits your contract. Once the version is confirmed, click on "Compile myFileName.sol" to compile the contract.

After successful compilation, move over to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, also found on the left sidebar. From the dropdown menu, choose the  contract and press the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the blockchain.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using functions like redeemRewards, purchaseSkin, or earnPoints. Input the necessary parameters for these functions to work, and once you've done so, click the designated buttons to execute the function and see the result of your interaction.
