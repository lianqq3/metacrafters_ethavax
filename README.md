# Valorant Points Manager (VPM)
The **Valorant Points Manager** is a Solidity-based smart contract that manages a playerâ€™s point system for a reward-based application. This contract allows users to earn points, redeem rewards, and ensures administrative controls for managing point-related configurations.
